# Task Summary

### Outline

This document serves as a summary of the tasks completed by each member of the group, in line with the project handout instructions.

Tasks for each page have been mainly divided into 3 parts:

-   'Design' - refers to creation of screen in Figma, selection of colours/fonts/layout, etc.
-   'Frontend' - refers to creation of XML files and View for that screen. May involve occasional work on Presenter for that screen, to integrate View.
-   'Backend' - refers to creation of presenter and associated model interactions for that screen. May involve occasional work on View for that screen, to integrate presenter.

Aside from these, there are also standalone tasks mentioned.

At times, two or more group members may have collaborated on a particular task, in which case that task appears in both of their descriptions.

### Disclaimer

For our approach to this project, we didn't just want to each take a page and do the entire frontend and backend individually, as this would lead to an app that doesn't feel cohesive in design (since pages would differ in design and backend in code structure from person to person).

Instead, we employed a highly collaborative approach where at the beginning of each sprint we would select 2 or 3 screens to focus on and split up frontend/backend work between group members. We would focus on the complete completion of these screens, ensuring cohesiveness in design and code structure through a high degree of collaboration, and then move on to the next screen.

Throughout the project's 3 sprints, we made sure to swap around design/frontend/backend work so that all group members completed a roughly even quantity of work of each type, so that all members are considered 'fullstack'. This is why you may see a particular member working on the frontend for one page and the backend for another, it just means they were done at different times.

Please also note that different tasks may have wildly differed in the quantity or difficulty of work needed, an individual's raw quantity of tasks does _not_ directly correspond to % contribution to the project.
