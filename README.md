# COSMOS - Your All-In-One CMS App
Cosmos allows you to register for events happening on campus, get notified of any announcements directly from the CMS department, assess your POSt eligibility with a single tap, and send complaints of feedback to the department. Furthermore, admins can view event-specific feedback and ratings, and create new events and announcements, while also answering any student complaints!
