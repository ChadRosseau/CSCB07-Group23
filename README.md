# COSMOS - Your All-In-One CMS App
Cosmos allows you to register for events happening on-campus, get notified of any announcements directly from the CMS department, assess your POSt eligibility with a single tap, and send complaints of feedback to the department. Furthermore, admins can view event specific feedbacks and ratings, create new events and announcements, while also answering to any student complaints!
